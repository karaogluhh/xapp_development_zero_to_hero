## Example Representations of ASN.1 in Python

This directory contains two representations of ASN.1 standard interface description in Python, created using the [PyCrate module](https://github.com/pycrate-org/pycrate), detailed below:

1. [E2AP](asn1/e2ap.py): Python representation of the [E2 Application Protocol (E2AP) Service Model specification](https://specifications.o-ran.org/download?id=582), providing the basic RIC Services for interacting with E2 Nodes. 
5. [KPM](asn1/kpm.py): Python representation of the [Key Performance Measurement (KPM) Service Model specification](https://specifications.o-ran.org/download?id=655), defining specific data structures and methods for the corresponding RAN Function.

This directory also provides 2 JSON files, showing how the information elements are structured and nested together. 

For additional information and context about their utilization, please refer to our tutorial paper.
