## Example commands 

This directory contains three listings to aid the xApp developer in performing different actions, detailed below:

1. [docker_commands](example_commands/docker_commands.md): Lists commands for building and pushing Docker images, as well as setting up and querying a local Docker Registry.
2. [dms_cli_commands](example_commands/dms_cli_commands.md): Lists commands for interacting with the AppMgr to onboard, (un)install, and inspect (or override) their Helm Charts.
3. [kubernetes_commands](example_commands/kubernetes_commands.md): Lists commands for interacting with Kubernetes to debug and inspect the operation of active xApp pods. 

For additional information and context about their utilization, please refer to our tutorial paper.
