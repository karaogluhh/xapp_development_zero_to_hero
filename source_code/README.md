## Example Source Code Files

This directory contains two source code files to aid the xApp developer in developing their xApps, detailed below:

1. [RMR XApp Main](source_code/rmrxapp_main.py): Example reactive xApp implementation, showing how to respond to signals, create configuration file handlers, register to RMR callbacks, and create subscriptions. 
2. [Xapp Main](source_code/rmrxapp_main.py): Example general xApp implementation, showing how to create an HTTP server, load parameters from the xApp descriptor, manipulate data from persistent storage, and react to REST calls. 

For additional information and context about their utilization, please refer to our tutorial paper.
